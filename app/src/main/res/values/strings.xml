    <string name="explained">"If you get an A, then I will give you a dollar."
The statement will be true if I keep my promise and false if I don"'"t."

"Suppose it"'"s true that you get an A and it"'"s true that I give you a dollar. Since I kept my promise, the implication is {\it true}. This corresponds to the first line in the table."

"Suppose it"'"s true that you get an A but it"'"s false that I give you a dollar. Since I didn"'"t keep my promise, the implication is false. This corresponds to the second line in the table."

"What if it"'"s false that you get an A? Whether or not I give you a dollar, I haven"'"t broken my promise. Thus, the implication can"'"t be false, so (since this is a two-valued logic) it must be true. This explains the last two lines of the table.
